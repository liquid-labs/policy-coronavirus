# Household Isolation Standards

## Purpose and scope

These standards describe the expectations and considerations involved in isolating one's immediate family or household during a pandemic or similar circumstances.

## Standards

### General

* <span id="47A38F33-C9F7-4250-BB8E-B57AB04FDF0F">Under lockdown, the home becomes a controlled environment where we take explicit steps in order to minimize the possibility of contamination within the home.</span>
* <span id="51CCA851-5D24-487D-A361-FAC5A8E57760">While under lockdown, maintain a strong sense of the boundary of your home and always assume that outside areas are uncontrolled and potentially a source of infection.</span>

### Isolate on entry

* <span id="77051AE1-7247-491F-A44D-BD2BE9275E79">Any individual entering the home should, if at all possible, remove and isolate "outside" clothes, and then wash their hands and face before putting on new clothes.</span>
* <span id="076721D9-63C4-4785-A823-0C3F275A3A93">Avoid bringing non-essential items into the home.</span>
* <span id="0D6DA190-100E-4C15-9914-51376F455092">Whenever possible, isolate and dispose of the outer package and/or packaging when unpacking items.</span>
* <span id="2B355130-EF12-4821-9374-276CF0B15E1D">If speaking to a non-family member, or a family member who has been outside, speak through the closed door or window, if possible, and maintain at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance if it is necessary to open the door. Request that anyone at the door stand at least 6 feet back from the door before answering.</span>
* <span id="DCBA7D57-799D-456E-BAF0-A36F4772F385">Whenever possible, have packages left just outside the door. If it is necessary to sign for an item, use common sense to minimize contact and wash your hands immediately afterwards. </span>

### High risk

* <span id="1E628269-8908-4100-BB8C-E3C94A1C1751">For households requiring a heightened assurance, all items coming into the home must be isolated and cleaned before use.</span>


## Guidelines for when to isolate

Anyone that is showing symptoms should isolate themselves from other household members.

Healthcare workers or others with significant exposure should observe in-house isolation protocols.
