# Social Distancing Standards

## Purpose and scope

These standards describe the when and how to maintain appropriate social distance during a pandemic or similar outbreak in both public and household interactions.

## Standards

### Space and surfaces

* <span id="F5C992CD-0601-4717-97DB-EAE8575932FC">In general, maintain a distance of 6 feet (2 meters) between yourself and other individuals. Even in situations where you may feel pressure or anxiety about leaving space, such as when queuing in a line, maintain that distance and understand that others are too.</span>
* <span id="7F64AAAE-9235-43BE-A105-7DA1999B0A29">Avoid sharing enclosed spaces with strangers. This specifically include buses, train cars, cabs, and elevators. Maintain asa much space as possible when necessary.</span>
* <span id="CC9D3720-375C-478B-A2DC-1F7EF2260F9B">Avoid touching surfaces unnecessarily. If possible, carry a pen to push buttons and disposable paper towels for grasping handles.</span>
* <span id="9D87DA4A-634F-4477-81B8-7BAF612542CC">While maintaining distance, nod, bow, or waive when greeting others.</span>

### Hygiene

* <span id="1B37DC9D-8E1B-4B87-9E35-F580484311D2">Always wash your hands before eating, before leaving your home, after using the restroom, and immediately after returning home.</span>
* <span id="E7F47784-4D4F-446F-8C90-6A476BCA5D7C">Avoid touching your face or clothes.</span>
* <span id="88361E6B-33C7-448E-9D9E-621CBF427807">When coughing or sneezing, turn away from others, look slightly down, and cough into either a disposable tissue or your raised shoulder-bicep. Do this even if others are not around to limit possible surface contamination.</span>
* <span id="BB201FDE-F662-4B70-9D92-27689113260D">If someone coughs or sneezes on or near you, either wash thoroughly or apply hand sanitizer to your hands and then, if necessary, your face.</span>
* <span id="ECD4F6FD-EC57-42D9-922D-5413F4A8A1FC">Clean work surfaces before use. Whenever possible, wipe down any keyboards, screens, tables, or generally any surface you need to interact with before use.</span>
* <span id="13CE89E6-1FF3-46B4-A39A-D388EA20D199">Clean up after yourself. If you cough or sneeze on something, clean the surface as best you can.</span>
* <span id="E512257F-DBB2-465A-BFB6-3D5414945CBE">It is neither generally recommended or useful to wear a dust or "surgical" style mask except in certain circumstances. Refer to the [mask usage guidelines](../Home%20Lockdown%20Framework.md#mask-usage-guidelines) for further information.</span>

### High risk

* <span id="8C1E4CBE-C086-477B-AA1E-47989356E45F">Individuals especially threatened by infection, or who are themselves infected should, if at all possible reach out to family, friends, community, and/or online resources to avoid leaving quarantine. For instance, rather than going to the store for food, find someone to do it for you. It is not only better for you to rest, but it is better for all of us.</span>
* <span id="242ABA35-DAE4-4785-94EC-9F816B6FCC19">Individuals especially threatened by infection, or who are themselves infected but cannot avoid leaving quarantine, should utilize a mask according to the [mask usage guidelines](../Home%20Lockdown%20Framework.md#mask-usage-guidelines).</span>

## Guidelines to maintain social cohesion

Move a little slower and allow space for others to work with you in maintaining social distance and keeping everyone self. These are stressful times and maintaining a sense of compassion and holding consideration for others can do a lot.

## Guidelines for dense urban areas

Maintaining "perfect" social distancing in a dense urban area can be especially challenging or even downright impossible. Use your judgement and apply the standards as best you can.

If possible, the use of a mask or shield may be warranted. Even in cases where the device itself does not provide any direct protection, it can serve as a useful social signaling device that can bring awareness to our collective duties. Others are likely to give you and perhaps reserve for themselves a little more distance and exercise just a bit more caution. This is, however, highly dependent on local customs and circumstances.
