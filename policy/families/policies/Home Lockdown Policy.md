## Purpose and scope

## Policy

### Scope

* <span id="7090158E-5E1C-4326-8B80-E359C91824B1">While the number and particular circumstances of individuals within a household are important factors in a lockdown, the [Home Lockdown Framework](../Home%20Lockdown%20Framework.md) aims to address most situations and be generally applicable for the great majority of the population.</span>
* <span id="CD97AC0D-FC4E-4EF0-BD9C-78F4A99864CF">It is vital that individuals using this framework consider their own circumstances carefully. This framework does not address every individuals specific needs directly.</span>
* <span id="0C6B49FF-35A9-41BC-ABC9-43DE74C10A95">This framework is intended to augment and support the advice and directives from medical professionals, government officials, and other health and safety experts.</span>
* <span id="7090158E-5E1C-4326-8B80-E359C91824B1">This framework comes with no guarantees. In the end, it is up to each individual to make the best decisions for themselves.</span>
* <span id="AEFE6B61-03D5-4124-89A5-F2BD53BE0929">While individual and household actions can be somewhat effective on their own, this framework requires mass participation in this or similar protocols to be effective. This is especially true for any densely populated area.</span>

### Roles

* <span id="E284EAEC-B31F-41C4-98B1-A19A95A42C69">Roles are assigned to responsible members of the household. In most households, each adult will hold multiple roles simultaneously, and in the case of a single-person household, that individual will hold all the roles.</span>
* <span id="F029A3DB-C94C-4C28-8071-BAFFBCE428BE">Roles can, and generally should be rotated when possible.</span>
* <span id="D20BAA3B-0E10-43FC-8989-3121EE22CF16">The Lockdown Coordinator is responsible for ensuring steps are followed and standards are met. The Lockdown Coordinator is especially vital during the initial implementation.</span>
* <span id="24D5566B-2247-403D-ACFB-27C034957F44">The Household Quartermaster is responsible for inventory and supply management.</span>
* <span id="398374B1-EFA3-4484-AE3C-F5C89D826C13">The Activity Coordinator is responsible for scheduling and preparing activities.</span>
* <span id="56C68D6A-9DB1-4807-9468-B7B7785BB7BD">The Health Coordinator is responsible for overseeing health and hygiene standards on an ongoing basis.</span>

### Purpose

* <span id="24904FF4-833E-4DCE-9324-E55F4446A304">Home lockdown greatly reduces the risk of day-to-day contagion within the populace. This slows the transmission of disease, which in turn reduces the acute impact on health care and lessens the long term negative economic consequences.</span>
* <span id="DB0DDEE8-A290-4046-85F8-C0A5FD70F414">At the individual level, the primary purpose is to reduce your exposure to the disease.</span>
* <span id="06C62C12-6AA2-424E-BC21-91F7FAB531CA">With that primary purpose in mind, this framework also seeks to lessen the social, emotional, and financial impact of a lockdown on household members.</span>
* <span id="30D2F725-2E94-4AB5-9C58-C37C0BD4C988">In particular, we want to create both the reality and sense that the home is a safe place for you and your household. A place where you do not need to worry or maintain strict vigilance.</span>

### Methods

* <span id="A54DA0F7-CC2A-4853-82C0-2A8D627ACA41">A lockdown is essentially about reducing exposure to potential transmission so the primary actions are to isolate and sanitize.</span>
* <span id="15E0A0B1-99BC-4C8D-8DAB-DE9D45C774CF">To be successful, the lockdown must be sustainable for weeks or even months. This addressing secondary actions to issues of mental, physical, social, and even financial well being.</span>
